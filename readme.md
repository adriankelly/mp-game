# Multiplication Learning Game - JavaScript Exercise

* [mp-game](https://mp-game.herokuapp.com/)


__Goal__: Production of a client-side Web application to help a child understand multiplication.

__Description__: The application will display a grid of all numbers from 1 to 144 evenly laid out with a large clickable box around each number. When the child clicks a box then all the numbers which are a multiple of that number are highlighted. Clicking a second time on a previously highlighted number removes all highlighting from numbers that are multiples of the number that is clicked.

__Constraints__: On mobile devices the grid will display 1 number per row. On tablet devices 2 numbers per row and on desktop and larger devices 3 numbers per row. Numbers fill their rows equally. When the screen width grows very large, a margin appears on either side of the grid so that the boxes donâ€™t keep getting larger.

No code libraries used.
